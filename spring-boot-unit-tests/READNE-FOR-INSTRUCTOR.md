# Spring Boot Application Testing: A Layered Approach with GitHub Copilot üöÄ

  

## Overview

  

This session will guide you through a comprehensive approach to testing a Spring Boot application, focusing on unit and integration tests across the **Repository**, **Service**, and **Controller** layers. We'll use **JUnit 5** and **Mockito** for our testing framework. A significant part of this demonstration will highlight how **GitHub Copilot** can be a powerful tool to accelerate test case generation and enhance test coverage. ‚ú®

  

## Project Context

  

This project features a simple Spring Boot application designed to manage user data. It consists of:

  

*  **`User` Entity**: A simple POJO representing a user with `name`, `email`, `gender`, and `age` attributes.

*  **`UserRepository`**: A Spring Data JPA repository for basic CRUD operations on `User` entities.

*  **`UserService`**: A service layer component that encapsulates business logic related to user management, interacting with the `UserRepository`.

*  **`UserController`**: A REST controller exposing two endpoints for user management:

*  `GET /api/v1/users`: Lists all existing users.

*  `POST /api/v1/users`: Creates a new user.

  

### Test Project Structure

  

For clarity and organization, your test classes are structured into dedicated sub-packages within the `src/test/java` directory:

  

*  `src/test/java/com/demo/app/repository` (e.g., `UserRepositoryTest.java`)

*  `src/test/java/com/demo/app/service` (e.g., `UserServiceTest.java`)

*  `src/test/java/com/demo/app/controller` (e.g., `UserControllerTest.java`)

## Technical Session Guide for the Instructor

  

Please follow these steps to lead an effective and engaging session on testing Spring Boot applications:

  

### Step 1: Initial Project Setup & Environment Verification üõ†Ô∏è‚úÖ

  

*  **Project Structure Introduction**: Begin by explaining the project's layout. Open the main Spring Boot project folder in your chosen code editor (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, VS Code). Highlight the main application code in `src/main/java` and the dedicated test packages in `src/test/java`.

*  **Maven Dependency Configuration**:

	*  **Crucial Step**: Ensure your `pom.xml` includes the necessary testing dependencies. You'll need:

	*  **`spring-boot-starter-test`**: This comprehensive starter provides JUnit 5, Mockito, Spring Test, and other common testing libraries.

	*  **`h2` database**: For in-memory database testing, which is perfect for `@DataJpaTest`.

	* Instruct participants to perform a clean Maven build (e.g., `mvn clean install`) to download all dependencies.

*  **Verify Application Functionality**:

	* Run the main Spring Boot application (e.g., `mvn spring-boot:run` or from your IDE).

	* Use a tool like Postman or a browser to confirm that the `GET /api/v1/users` and `POST /api/v1/users` endpoints are functioning as expected. This sets our baseline for the application's behavior.

### Step 2: Repository Layer Testing (`@DataJpaTest`) üíæüß™

  

*  **Objective**: Test the `UserRepository` in isolation, verifying its interaction with the database. We'll use `@DataJpaTest`, which sets up an in-memory H2 database specifically for your JPA tests.

*  **Setup**:

* In `src/test/java/com/demo/app/repository`, create `UserRepositoryTest.java`.

* Annotate the class with `@DataJpaTest`.

* Inject the `UserRepository` using `@Autowired`.

*  **Manual Test Case**:

*  **Integrate your own simple test case here**. This test should demonstrate saving a `User` entity to the repository and then verifying its persistence and properties.

*  **Run Manual Test**: Execute this single test case. **It's crucial that it passes (turns green)** to confirm your basic repository test setup is correct.

*  **Ask GitHub Copilot for More Tests**:

* Open `UserRepository.java` (or `UserRepositoryTest.java`) in your IDE, ensuring Copilot has the relevant context.

* In the Copilot Chat panel, use the prompt:

```

/tests Generate additional valid use cases for this repository, including appropriate mock setups. Please ensure all test scenarios are meaningful and reflect realistic behavior.

```

*  **Observe and Integrate**: Review Copilot's suggestions (e.g., `findByEmail`, `findAll`, `deleteById`). Copy and paste relevant test methods into `UserRepositoryTest.java`.

### Step 3: Service Layer Testing (`@ExtendWith(MockitoExtension.class)`) ‚öôÔ∏èüß™

  

*  **Objective**: Test the `UserService`'s business logic in isolation. For this, we'll use Mockito to mock the `UserRepository` dependency, controlling its behavior without hitting an actual database.

*  **Setup**:

* In `src/test/java/com/demo/app/service`, create `UserServiceTest.java`.

* Annotate the class with `@ExtendWith(MockitoExtension.class)`.

* Use `@InjectMocks` to create and inject mocks into your `UserService` instance, and `@Mock` to create mock instances of `UserRepository`.

*  **Manual Test Case**:

*  **Integrate your own simple test case here**. This test should cover calling `userService.createUser()`, ensuring you mock the `userRepository.save()` method's expected return value.

*  **Run Manual Test**: Execute this test, confirming it passes.

*  **Ask GitHub Copilot for More Tests**:

* Open `UserService.java` (or `UserServiceTest.java`).

* In the Copilot Chat panel, use the prompt:

```

/tests Generate additional valid use cases for this service, including appropriate mock setups. Please ensure all test scenarios are meaningful and reflect realistic behavior.

```

*  **Observe and Integrate**: Review Copilot's suggestions (e.g., `listAllUsers`, handling null input for creation, edge cases like invalid email formats). Copy and paste relevant test methods into `UserServiceTest.java`.

### Step 4: Controller Layer Testing (`@WebMvcTest`) üåêüß™

  

*  **Objective**: Test the `UserController` endpoints by simulating HTTP requests without starting a full Spring Boot server. We'll use Spring's `MockMvc` for this.

*  **Setup**:

* In `src/test/java/com/demo/app/controller`, create `UserControllerTest.java`.

* Annotate the class with `@WebMvcTest(controllers = UserController.class)`.

* Use `@AutoConfigureMockMvc(addFilters = false)` to disable any filters (like `AuthFilter` if present in your actual app) to ensure isolated controller testing.

* Annotate with `@ExtendWith(MockitoExtension.class)`.

* Inject `MockMvc` using `@Autowired`.

* Use `@MockBean` (Spring's way to add mocks to the application context for `@WebMvcTest`) to mock the `UserService` dependency.

*  **Manual Test Case**:

*  **Integrate your own simple test case here**. This test should perform a `POST` request to `/users`, provide a JSON request body for a new user, and assert the HTTP status (e.g., `isCreated()`) and basic JSON response content.

*  **Run Manual Test**: Execute this test, confirming it passes.

*  **Ask GitHub Copilot for More Tests**:

* Open `UserController.java` (or `UserControllerTest.java`).

* In the Copilot Chat panel, use the prompt:

```

/tests Generate additional valid use cases for this controller, including appropriate mock setups. Please ensure all test scenarios are meaningful and reflect realistic behavior.

```

*  **Observe and Integrate**: Review Copilot's suggestions (e.g., `GET /users` with empty/non-empty list, `POST` with invalid user data, error handling scenarios). Copy and paste relevant test methods into `UserControllerTest.java`.

  

---

  

### Step 5: Run All Tests and Analyze Results ‚ñ∂Ô∏è‚úÖ

  

*  **Objective**: Execute the full suite of tests across all layers and interpret the outcomes.

*  **Steps**:

1.  **Run All Tests**: In your IDE, trigger a run of all test cases within the `src/test/java` directory.

2.  **See the Result**: Observe the test results.

*  **Green**: All tests passed. This indicates that the application's components behave as expected across all tested scenarios and layers.

*  **Red (Failures)**: Some tests failed. This is an opportunity to:

*  **Debug**: Investigate the failing test. Is the test case itself incorrect? Or is there a bug in the application logic at that specific layer?

*  **Refine**: Adjust the application code or the test case until it passes.

*  **Discussion Point**: Emphasize the value of a layered testing strategy for pinpointing issues and ensuring robust application development.
